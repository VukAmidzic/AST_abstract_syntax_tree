## About
This is a rework written in C++ that constructs AST tree and compiles it into assembly code. Basic arithmetic, comparison and logical operations supported, as well as assigning and printing operations.

### Project goals
 - [ ] (Fix some minor bugs regarding the assembly code
 - [ ] (Implement if-else statement)

## Running the program
First, type
```
make
```
to compile files and get a parser.
Until this project gets finished, you can type your program in ``` test.fkc ``` file.
After that, type
```
make run
```
to run your created parser.
The result of parser will be a generated assembly code by AST syntax tree.

At the end, type
```
./test
```
to see the result of assembly code that will be printed to the terminal :) .
