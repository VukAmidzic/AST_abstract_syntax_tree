## About
This is an attempt to make an AST abstract syntax tree in C
that currently supports addition,substraction, multiplication
and division.

## Running the program
Type 
```
make
```
to generate an assembly code written in 'test' file.
Then, run that file 
```
./test
```
after which you need to write 
```
echo $?
```
to see the result of a tree in main.c.
You can also change the tree to you liking.
