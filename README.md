## About
This is an attempt to make an AST abstract syntax tree in C
that currently supports addition, subtraction, multiplication
and division (comparison will be done in the future), and also makes an assembly code.

## Running the program
First, type
```
make
```
to compile files and get a parser.
After that, type
```
make run
```
to run your created parser.
The result of parser will be a generated assembly code by AST syntax tree.

At the end, type
```
./test
```
to see the result of assembly code that will be printed to the terminal :) .
